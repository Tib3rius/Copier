# Copier

Copier is a Burp Suite extension (compatible with both Community and Professional editions) which allows users to easily copy requests and responses while making automated modifications using custom rules.

This allows requests and responses to be easily copied into reports without editing to remove large cookie values, extraneous headers, or sensitive data. To watch Copier in action, please watch this YouTube video:
